Layers:
	Wire
		We'll want to be able to code the wire layer regardless of what's up.
	Proto
		SPI proto is already coded in kernel and in libraries, but will need a way
		to plug in our own wire layer.
		Maybe better to not use kernel so as not to duplicate possible bugs or idiosyncracies,
		but rather verify they are not present?
	Data
		The kernel does some of this, but we'll want to manage some ourself.
